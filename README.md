#FixMyRide -  Vehicle repairs are just a few taps away (Capstone_FixMyRide_CH2-PS481)

According to the International Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (IJEECS), Indonesia stands out among ASEAN countries, boasting the highest number of motorcycle users, with around one-third of its population owning motorcycles. The prevalence of sudden motorcycle damage poses a significant obstacle to users' daily activities, and a noteworthy proportion of these users lacks awareness of the root causes of such damages (Naryanto et al., 2022).

Adding to the challenge, tight work schedules contribute to the neglect of regular vehicle servicing among users. Compounding this issue is the persistence of a manual system in the service process, hindering overall efficiency (Mahendra et al., 2020). In response to these challenges, mobile technology offers new possibilities for the improvement of business processes and enables new process designs (Falk & Leist, 2014). Of course, by implementing a mobile application for the motorbike repair shop business needs will change and improve.

We present a proactive solution—an innovative application meticulously designed to identify early issues faced by riders and provide customized recommendations for effective solutions. Leveraging machine learning recommendation technology, seamlessly integrated with a cloud computing architecture, and tailored for mobile use, the application promises a remarkably user-friendly experience. Moreover, this application encompasses features aimed at expanding users' knowledge base and streamlining the convenient location of nearby repair shops, ushering in a new era of efficiency and convenience for the motorbike repair shop business.
